# [Nextendo] Release-time bake, driven by CI secrets/env — never committed with real values.
#
# The open-source tree resolves the Nextendo server addresses from environment variables and
# falls back to loopback (see DnsMitmResolver / NextendoNetworkCheck), and ships ReleaseInformation
# with %%RYUJINX_...%% placeholders. Official builds run this once, on a throwaway CI checkout, to
# bake the real addresses in and stamp the version. Addresses come from the NEXTENDO_SERVER_IP /
# NEXTENDO_NAT_IP secrets, never from this file.
#
# Usage: NEXTENDO_SERVER_IP=... NEXTENDO_NAT_IP=... bake_release.py <version> <git_hash>

server = os.environ["NEXTENDO_SERVER_IP"].strip()
nat = os.environ["NEXTENDO_NAT_IP"].strip()
# nncs NAT-check responders: default to the backend IPs (single-host setup) but can be set
# independently, so the NAT check stays put when the account/game backend moves (e.g. onto nx1).

# Two-phase on purpose: EVERY pattern is checked before ANY file is written.
# A partial bake used to be possible -- one file rewritten, the next pattern missing, the run
# aborted -- and the resulting tree still builds: ReleaseInformation keeps its %% placeholders,
# so IsValid is false and the version/update gates are silently inactive in a shipped build.
# Better to touch nothing at all than to leave that behind.
